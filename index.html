    <h4>Our school</h4>

    <p> Our school aims to prepare students for a future in an unknown job market, where people skills are as important
        as
        tech skills. We give our girls access to the resources they need to explore their world and develop into the
        people
        they want to be.
        <br>Personal drive is celebrated here, and we like to give our students the opportunity to pursue any area that
        interests them.</br>
